# 795-Project-Improved
Simulation of buses along a single route with stations and passengers.  
Originally planned as a Python project, currently being written in Java, 
now in the second iteration of its existence. 

The original project started as a simple discrete simulation of bus traffic.
The desire to scale the simulation to be able to handle large amounts of traffic
necessitated a first rewrite using randomly generated PassengerGroups.

The second major rewrite happened as the natural optimization questions came into
existence.
